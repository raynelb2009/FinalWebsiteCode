        Thursday, May 26 2022 was an auspicious morning. A beautiful autumn
        morning, clear with starry skies, crisp, but not cold, no wind, no rain. I
        was up early, excited to see the fruits of decades of dreaming, years of
        planning and many months of meticulous construction finally revealed
        to the Whitianga community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a personal stake in this story. An ex-student of Mercury Bay Area
        School, I returned in 1999 and had the privilege of working alongside Matua 
        Raniera Turoa ‘Duce’ Pohatu as kai awhina, ‘helper’ in the first bi-
        lingual unit at the school. We often spoke of our whānau’s dream of a
        whare that could be the heart of our kura, a place our children felt
        proud of, a whare for the community. On this morning 23 years later,
        that collective dreaming was becoming a reality. Current teachers Marcus Oxenam 
        and Jo Kaaho were both there in 1999 too, a very special full circle for them. 
        Good things take time. Matua Duce often said that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Master carver and artist James Webster has a long association with the
        area too. Although he currently lives in Coromandel, his ties to Whiti
        City are strong. He has whānau here, he and his wife Hinemoa resided
        here for many years, and their two children attended M.B.A.S. for a
        short while in 2019, and many people of our community wear moko
        from him. Artistically he is woven into this land too – through the Tuia
        250 project at Wharekaho, and Manukarere that graces Taylor’s Mistake. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was back in 2016 that James, in concert with Joe Davis and others,
        first conceived of the project to adorn the wharenui shaped classroom
        at the front of the school. To adorn it in a way that would tell stories of
        the pre-European history of the area, provide meaningful, rich learning
        opportunities, and reflect the Māori students and whānau here and now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2008 James enjoyed two weeks as artist in residence at M.B.A.S,
        focusing on tāonga puoro, Māori instruments. During this time, he and
        his friend Michelle Lee composed a patere, a rhythmic song, called ‘He
        tītī, e rere’. In the patere we learn of landmarks, people and stories
        featured in kōrero shared by local iwi Ngāti Hei. The flight of a tītī, a
        muttonbird, takes us around some of the important landmarks and
        geography of the area, an aural map, Māori learning style. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Songs is a common educational tool for Māori. Through the repetition of
        waiata, information is transferred to the student. Patterns in carving,
        moko and other art forms also convey information. As James says, the
        learning is “encapsulated rhythmically through vibration and helps us
        connect back into some of the history, the whakapapa”. Most people
        think of genealogy when they hear that word, but it is more than that.
        At its essence, whakapapa is the layering of the land and all the people
        that occupy the land with each other. As we come into the world and
        stand on the land, and as we go, passing back into the whenua from
        whence we all come. Everything has whakapapa; this article tells a little
        of the whakapapa of Te Whare Puahape, the land upon which it sits,
        and its people.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the patere ‘He tītī e rere’, our avian guide begins its flight presiding
        over Ohinau Island before diving into the waters of Te Whanganui-o-Hei and 
        over to Tāhanga, the maunga at Ōpito. This is the mountain where
        the famous basalt is found, which was a significant economic
        commodity for local hapu and iwi. Adzes fashioned at Ōpito were
        traded with others all over the country. See, you’re learning already!
        Circling back over the sands of Wharekaho, to Ohuka ’Brophy’s Beach’,
        on to Taputapuātea ‘Mother Brown’s creek’ and on up the estuary,
        Whangamaroro – maroro is the flying fish. This patere forms the basis
        of what James has translated visually onto the whare. Let’s take a tour.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a curved formation of pou manu at the front with the waharoa,
        the carved gateway in the middle. “To me it represents coming through
        that entrance way, the threshold, taking a new step into your education.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a seed, growing, and then through your ascent up the poutama of
        education, you will take flight.” There is a pattern called kape rua,
        representing seeds, all over the whole waharoa. “It is a pattern mainly
        associated with Ngāti Porou, but the symbolism was fitting, the seeds
        of potentiality.” The figure at the top of the waharoa as you enter
        represents Tāwhirimātea, god of weather, ‘the one who helped Tāne on
        his quest to collect the baskets of knowledge’; more about those 3 kete
        of knowledge later. 
      </p>
      <p>
        “The whole construction and design idea stemmed from one of my main
        tutors and mentors in carving, Paki Harrison. He carved Tanenui-a-
        Rangi up in Auckland. He is quite responsible for shifting the narrative
        around the way houses were represented. To make them more pliable
        for today. A lot of the old houses were about tūpuna (ancestors).”
        Perfectly fitting for wharenui at marae, solely representing the
        whakapapa of that particular area. But incorporating the overarching
        gods and stories is more appropriate for a building that represents and
        welcomes an entire school and community made up of many different
        iwi and nationalities. I’m sure everyone that goes to meet Te Whare
        Puahape will be able to find an element they can relate to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are through the waharoa, through the gate, and you look at
        the whare you will see two figures flanking it. On the left is te ira
        wahine, representing the feminine energy personified as Papatūānuku,
        our mother earth. Balancing that on the right is te ira tāne, the
        masculine energy personified as Ranginui, our father sky. All over
        Papatūānuku’s cloak is a pattern called tāne whakapiripiri. A pattern
        from the forest. It can be seen when you pull vegetation aside to reveal
        the intertwined nature of the root systems of seemingly individual
        plants, bound together. It speaks to her tendrils that flow out, giving life
        to our forests and plants and to us. See if you can see Ruaomoko
        nestled under his mothers’ cloak.

    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Ascending from those 2 figures are the maihi, they form the peak of the
         roof, and speak of ngā rangi tūhāhā – the 12 heavenly realms that Tāne
         journeyed through to acquire the 3 baskets of knowledge, and bring
         them back down to humanity, planting them in the ground. “We can see
         each other as the whānau tītī, helping each other on the quest for
         enlightenment through education.” During Tāne’s quest for knowledge,
         his sibling Whiro was constantly trying to thwart him, challenging him at
         every turn. He had many obstacles to overcome, as we all have when
         we learn something new. There are also 12 cycles in the maramataka,
         the Māori calendar. There are 12 on one side and 12 on the other. One
         side ascending from te ira wahine, and one ascending from te ira tāne.
         That is because in each of the twelve upper realms there are two apa,
         or spiritual beings: māreikura, representing the female essence, and
         whatukura, the male essence.
      </p>
      <p>
         But it's not all other worlds and spiritual beings on those maihi. Look
         closely at the designs and they appear as a helix, the way DNA is
         depicted. James shares some fascinating etymology relating to this.
         “The ‘ne’ in the words tāne and wahine can be thought of as dna. With
         ‘ta’ meaning to inscribe or impart, as in ta moko, to inscribe on the skin,
         impart a tattoo. So the role of tane can be thought of to impart DNA.
         And ‘wahi’, as in wahine means place. The place in which DNA is
         planted, where it is fertilised and brought to life.” Wow, these pieces of
         wood are able to impart a lot of knowledge. And remind us of the
         universal truth: we are the descendants of our ancestors and also, the
         soon-to-be ancestors of our descendants. A great reminder to leave
         them a healthy legacy, to take into account the wisdom from the past
         and consider our descendants of future generations when making
         decisions today. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Linking the pou to the porch, or the mahau, we have the poutama
         pattern. You can recognise it by its stairlike form, an educational pattern
         to do with learning. As you absorb the knowledge, you ascend; it can
         be a steep learning curve, and you sometimes plateau. “You feed back
         to the community as well, there's no point in learning if you can't share
         it.”
      </p>
      <p>
         One of the biggest features around this place is the ocean, Tangaroa.
         Pretty easy to spot up on the porch, clothed in beautiful blue. “The
         spirals either side of the doorway represent the cyclic ebb and the flow
         of the tides, and of energy, tai timu, tai pare. Birds, fish and all the
         creatures dwelling in and around the ocean show the abundance that
         flows in and out of this area.” See how many different creatures you can
         spot.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the sides of the porch, we return to the patere and the flight of our
         tītī. On the right is Taputapuātea, Mother Brown’s Creek, which is also
         connected to Rangiātea, the homeland. A whare, a house, that
         represents human habitation, and putting your pou in the ground,
         building a strong foundation. On the left side you can see male and
         female forms again, they are the same symbol but alternating facing up
         and down. “Carrying on the theme of reproduction and that we humans
         are what make life what it is, between the sky and earth. Below those
         figures is a whiri pattern, or the whariki of Hineteiwaiwa, the mat that is
         laid before us to weave, and make of life what we will.” Look for a little
         mountain there, representing Ōhinau Island again.
      </p>
      <p>
         The mountain is also included as an element of pepeha. When
         introducing yourself so people listening can make connections to your
         whakapapa, you name your mountain, river, waka, marae and your
         people. All of those elements are depicted.
      </p>
      <p>
         When you are on the mahau, the porch, looking for all those elements,
         don’t forget to look up or you might miss one. Waka forms are above
         you on the tuanui. “They are above you because our ancestors had to
         look up to see the stars that navigated them across vast oceans.”
      </p>
      <p>
         Between the waharoa and the steps at the whare is the star compass,
         divided into the 32 quadrants of the horizon that allow you to map your
         position. If you know how of course, another learning opportunity. The
         star compass brings to mind a whakataukī told to James by Ricky
         Solomon, a maramataka knowledge keeper from Ngāti Kahungunu.
      </p>
      <p>
         Tuia ki terangi, tuia ki te whenua, tuia ki te moana, ka rongo te pō, ka
         rongo te ao. Sew on the ground, sew on the ground, sew on the sea, and the 
         night will hear, and the world heard. 
      </p>
      <p>
         What is in the heavens is bound to the land and sea, balancing in the
         heavens between night and day. The compass is correctly orientated,
         so it’s functional. It’s also a games board. James and his wife Hinemoa
         taught some of the children at the school how to play the strategy
         game Mū Tōrere. So the star compass is as layered as the rest of Te
         Whare Puahape.
      </p>
      <p>
         There was so much I couldn’t fit into this article. But that’s good. We
         can all always learn more. Go and have a walk, talk to anyone you might
         find sitting on the steps, or playing on the star compass. Mercury Bay is
         fortunate to have this multi-layered building, a world class art work, a
         library of knowledge, and an inspiring place of learning for our
         community. Matua Duce would be very happy.
